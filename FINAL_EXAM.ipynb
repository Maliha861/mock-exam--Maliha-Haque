        "Please analyse this broken_task_manager.py code for a beginner programming student.\n",
        "Identify the types of errors a Week 6 level student might make, focusing on variable names, function calls, list handling, and basic logic.\n",

        "Line 8 – Typo in variable name (tas instead of tasks)\n",
        "The condition if index < len(tas): references a variable that doesn’t exist.\n",
        "This will cause a NameError because tas is undefined. It should be corrected to len(tasks) to match the list created earlier.\n",
        "\n",
        "Line 16 – Wrong variable used in the loop\n",
        "The line for i, t in enumerate(task): uses task, which is not defined in this scope.\n",
        "The correct variable name is tasks, the global list being looped through. This causes a NameError when trying to display tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Line 24 – Incorrect function name\n",
        "The line list_task() calls a function that doesn’t exist. The correct name is list_tasks().\n",
        "This will raise a NameError since Python can’t find a function named list_task.\n",
        "\n",
        "Line 7 – Incomplete index validation\n",
        "Even after fixing the typo, the current condition only checks if the index is smaller than the list length.\n",
        "It doesn’t check for negative numbers, which could still delete unintended items. A better condition is:\n",
        "if 0 <= index < len(tasks):.\n",
        "\n",
        "Logical design issue (multiple lines)\n",
        "All functions depend on a global variable tasks.\n",
        "While acceptable for beginners, passing tasks as a function parameter would make the program easier to test and debug.\n",
        "\n",
        "Comparison of Findings:\n",
        "I was able to identify the key mistakes in the code, such as the wrong variable name, incorrect loop variable (task), and the wrong function call (list_task()).\n",
        "I used the step-by-step debugging habits taught in Week 1 – Fixing Mistakes in Python.\n",
        "My manual review focused on reading each line carefully and checking if variable names matched their definitions, which helped me catch the most obvious issues.\n",
        "The AI, however, provided a more complete analysis by pointing out additional logic problems, like missing negative index validation and global variable use.\n",
        "The testing approach from Week 3– Testing and Refining the Weather Forecaster also helped me understand how these issues could affect program behaviour when running with different inputs.\n",
        "Overall, my manual check caught the main syntax errors, while the AI highlighted deeper structural improvements I hadn’t considered.\n",
        "\n",
        "Course Reference:\n",
        "I applied the debugging approach from Week 1- Fixing Mistakes in Python and Week 3– Testing and Refining the Weather Forecaster.\n",
        "Week 1 taught me to carefully read error messages and check for typos, naming, and syntax issues line by line.\n",
        "Week 3 introduced a structured testing method to run code with different inputs and observe unexpected behaviour.\n",
        "Combining these two approaches helped me locate the exact lines causing errors in the program and understand how they affected the program’s logic and output."
